Before my Ph.D, I completed B.Sc. degrees in Computer Science and Environmental Science, and a minor in Statistics and Analytics at UNC Chapel Hill.",
    "research" : "I develop algorithms to estimate the adaptive potential of small-scale agriculture in poverty-ridden areas. Previously, I used remote sensing algorithms to monitor the rehabilitation of coastal ecosystems with the RESCuE Consortium in Thailand. I was a founding member of Acta Solutions, a tech start-up that helps local governments optimize decisions using constituent data. More recently, I worked with Curamericas Global to support underserved communities during Covid-19.",
